### By Edmond Verdier & Arthur Naudy
Welcome to Foodprints, an interactive data visualization app that explores the environmental impact of food items. This app is the final project of a lesson about data visualization given at Ecole Centrale de Lyon. Our objective was to create an interactive visualization from scratch using D3 (JavaScript) and Observable Notebooks on the topic "Climate Change".

## Purpose
The purpose of the Foodprints app is to help users understand the overall impact of food items on the environment. We focused our work on deconstructing common misconceptions about the environmental impact of food, such as the belief that consuming local products is better for the environment. Through our research, we learned that eating seasonal food is much more important than local food for the environment.

## Features
The Foodprints app has several features that allow users to interact with the data and explore different aspects of the environmental impact of food. These features include:

* **Interactive Charts**: 
The app features several interactive charts that allow users to explore the environmental impact of different food items. Users can filter the data by food group, and life cycle steps to get a better understanding of the impact of different foods.

* **Data Tables**: 
Users can also explore the data in a table format, which provides more detailed information about the environmental impact of each food item.

* **My Plate (coming soon)**: 
The My Plate feature allows users to see the environmental impact of their own food choices. Users can add food items to their plate and see the cumulative impact on the environment.

* **Resources**: 
The app also provides resources for users who want to learn more about the environmental impact of food and how they can reduce their own impact.

## Technologies Used
The Foodprints app was built using D3 (JavaScript) and Observable Notebooks. D3 is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. It allows for the creation of complex, interactive data visualizations in a web browser. Observable Notebooks is a web-based interactive computing environment that allows users to create and share live code, visualizations, and explanatory text.

## Data Source
The data used in the Foodprints app was obtained from **Our World in Data**, a research project at the University of Oxford that aims to make research and data on the world's largest problems accessible and understandable. Our World in Data provides data and research on a wide range of topics, including climate change and food production. We have used their data on the environmental impact of different food items to create the charts and tables in the Foodprints app.

## Installation
The Foodprints app is a web-based application and does not require any installation. Users can simply visit the app's URL (https://arthurndy.github.io/FoodPrints.github.io/) in their web browser to access the app.

## Usage
To use the Foodprints app, simply navigate to the app's URL in your web browser. Once you are on the app's homepage, you can start exploring the different features of the app. You can use and click on the interactive charts to explore the environmental impact of different food items, or you can select and filter the charts using the predefined groups. You can also find other informations regarding the project via the menu on the top right of your screen.

## Conclusion
We hope that the Foodprints app will help users better understand the environmental impact of food and make more informed food choices. By focusing on the impact of seasonal food rather than local food, we hope to challenge common misconceptions and encourage users to think critically about the impact of their food choices. Thank you for using our app, and we welcome any feedback or suggestions for improvement.
